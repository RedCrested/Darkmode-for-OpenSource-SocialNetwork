# Darkmode Swich

Give your users the convenience of switching to dark mode with just one click! The dark mode component integrates seamlessly with Awesome and GoBlue themes, adding a stylish switch to the top-right dropdown menu.

If you need to add some selector in your CSS file, duplicate your selector and add  **[data-theme="dark"]** before the name of selector. Here an example:

| **Light mode**                                     | **Dark mode**                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|<pre> body {<br>     background-color: #ffffff; <br> } </pre>| <pre>[data-theme="dark"] body {<br>     background-color: #eaeaea;<br> } </pre>|

**Awesome theme**
